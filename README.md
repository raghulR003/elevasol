# A small setup guide for this project


- Open the folder: client/src/scenes/geography and open cmd there
- Then open the map.html inside on a live server and note it's url
- Open the index.html on the same geography folder, and replace the url with the existent src url

- Before opening, check if the link: https://infoserverpro.onrender.com/ is live.

- Then open two cmd tabs, one in client folder and another in server folder.
- In the cmd tab inside server folder, run 'npm run dev'
- In the cmd tab inside client folder, run 'npm start'. This will start the webpage and we are able to view everything now.
